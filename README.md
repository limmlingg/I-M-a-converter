# Hi human, I-M a converter!
"I'll help you automatically convert those pesky measurements into your preferred units, be it imperial, metric or SI."

"However, I-M still under development because I haven't learnt all the different units and type of measurements yet. Please stay tuned for my release!"

## Features

### Must-Haves
* Automatic conversion of all recognisable units, for example
  * 째F to 째C
  * ft to cm/m
  * miles to km
  * sqft to sqm
  * inches to cm/m
  * lbs to g/kg
* Hover over the underlined number on any webpage to see a tooltip of the conversions

### Nice-to-Haves
* Some NLP to easily recognise units (likely using an NLP library), for example
  * 30 째F
  * thirty degrees fahrenheit
  * fahrenheit 30
  * 30째 Fahrenheit
* Detect or approximate what is being measured and what units to convert it to, for example
  * the area of a small studio apartment should not be converted to acres
  * the weight of a human person should be in kg, not g
* User preferences, such as
  * only convert temperature and length
  * only convert to kg
  * only convert from metric to imperial
  * number of decimal places for each unit
  * change css styling of a translated number (text decoration, colour etc.)
