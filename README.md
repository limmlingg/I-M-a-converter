### Nice-to-Haves
* Some NLP to easily recognise units (likely using an NLP library), for example
  * 30 째F
  * thirty degrees fahrenheit
  * fahrenheit 30
  * 30째 Fahrenheit
* Detect or approximate what is being measured and what units to convert it to, for example
  * the area of a small studio apartment should not be converted to acres
  * the weight of a human person should be in kg, not g
* User preferences, such as
  * only convert temperature and length
  * only convert to kg
  * only convert from metric to imperial
  * change css styling of a translated number (text decoration, colour etc.)
